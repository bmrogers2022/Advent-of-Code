# Day 9 Notes

Late solution today because I had a final

# Part One
###### Personal difficulty rating = 2

### Solution logic
Another easily brute forceable problem. Just gonna start with that and hope that it also works for part two.

# Part Two
###### Personal difficulty rating = 2

### Solution logic
Brute forcing should work too (literally the exact same code, just reverse the list). What a chill and easy day for my final.
