# Day 5 Notes

Why would they do this to us

# Part One
###### Personal difficulty rating = 2

### Solution logic
It took me forever to even understood how this problem worked. The logic shouldn't be too difficult to implement, but I am worried about writing a brute force solution with numbers this big. I remember doing some problem where comparing huge numbers was necessary. Before I write some code that checks within bounds more efficiently, I am going to write out the naive approach and just implement faster code afterwards if it does not work.

### Exceptions to logic
Last line of data must have a new line char at the end of it for this implementation to work

# Part Two
###### Personal difficulty rating = (TODO)

### Solution logic
Upon reviewing how long operations take in python, comparing integers is not the reason the solution here is slow. This means that there must be some method to not run every single integer in the range we are given.
