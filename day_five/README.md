# Day 5 Notes

Why would they do this to us

# Part One
###### Personal difficulty rating = 2

### Solution logic
It took me forever to even understood how this problem worked. The logic shouldn't be too difficult to implement, but I am worried about writing a brute force solution with numbers this big. I remember doing some problem where comparing huge numbers was necessary. Before I write some code that checks within bounds more efficiently, I am going to write out the naive approach and just implement faster code afterwards if it does not work.

### Exceptions to logic
Last line of data must have a new line char at the end of it for this implementation to work

# Part Two
###### Personal difficulty rating = (TODO)

### Solution logic
Part two of the problem is the same problem but on a much larger scale, forcing me to implement a more efficient approach.

### Exceptions to logic
