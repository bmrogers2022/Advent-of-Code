# Day 6 Notes

I was not able to complete part 2 of day five within 24 hours, but I will continue doing the problems and go back to day 5 occasionally as I believe I have a working method.

# Part One
###### Personal difficulty rating = 1

### Solution logic
Looks to be an easily brute-forceable problem, so I will be doing that to help me recover from yesterday

# Part Two
###### Personal difficulty rating = 1

### Solution logic
I assume the intention here was to make us use math, but brute forcing it actually still works which essentially made it even easier than part one.
