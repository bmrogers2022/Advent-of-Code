# Day 10 Notes

No motivation to do part 2 of this problem at all unfortunately, think I'll be calling it here. I just know it would be another 8+ hour problem, especially with how sloppy my solution to part one was. We had a good run.

# Part One
###### Personal difficulty rating = 4

### Solution logic
Seems to be a simple BFS solution, except we want the longest distance instead of the shortest. I admittedly haven't done one of these in awhile, so it should be good practice.  
Updated: On second thought, I can just traverse the entire path and then divide by two, so I'll do that because its slightly faster.
